# About Project

This Project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In this Project I created a "Tic-Tac-Toe" game React App using React.memo and different React Hooks like useContext, useMemo, useReducer and useCallback.

## Available Scripts

In the Project directory you can run:

### `npm i`

Runs installation of the dependencies to the local `node_modules` folder.

### `npm start`

Runs the App in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
